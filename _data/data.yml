    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Hello, I'm a Ph.D student at Music and Audio Computing Lab, KAIST, advised by Prof. Juhan Nam.
      My current research focuses on music generation and differentiable DSP, especially instrument and singing voice synthesis.
      I'm also interested in generative models such as GAN, diffusion etc. I like writing songs and lyrics with my acoustic guitar.
